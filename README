./attach_ebs.sh: Error: you must supply either EBS_TAG_VALUE or EBS_VOLUME_ID
Usage: ./attach_ebs.sh [OPTIONS]
v1.1

Attempts to attach an EBS volume to an EC2 instance (by default, the current
EC2 instance). Can look for a particular EBS tag:Name, or a specific VOLUME_ID.

First waits for the volume to exist (up to '-T' time). Then waits for the volume
to be available to attach. Then attaches the volume. Then waits for the volume
to be attached.

Once the volume is attached:

  If FS_TYPE was passed: looks for filesystem type FS_TYPE on device 
  MOUNT_DEVICE. If the filesystem is not detected, and '-p' is specified, 
  creates a partition NAME (pass PARTED_SCRIPT or SFDISK_SCRIPT to customize
  partition creation). A filesystem is created on the resulting device.

  The DEVICE is mounted to DIRECTORY.
  If none already exists, an fstab entry is added for the mount.
  If a USER was passed, the newly mounted directory is 'chown'ed to that user.


Options:
    -i EC2_ID           The AWS EC2 instance ID (detected with EC2 metadata)
    -r REGION           The AWS region (detected with EC2 metadata)
    -V VOLUME_ID        Attach VOLUME_ID EBS volume instead of looking for the
                        volume with the '-t' option below
    -n NAME             Match an EBS volume with a tag named NAME (default: 'Name')
    -t VALUE            Match an EBS volume whose tag:NAME value is VALUE
    -T TIMEOUT          Seconds to try looking for an EBS volume with '-t'
    -d DEVICE           Mount EBS volume from DEVICE file
    -m DIRECTORY        Mount EBS volume on DIRECTORY
    -u USER             Make USER the owner of the newly-mounted DIRECTORY
    -F TYPE             The filesystem type to create if none exists
    -O OPTS             The filesystem mount options
    -L LABEL            The filesystem label name
    -p PART             Create partition name by concatenating DEVICE and PART
    -S                  Shutdown the host if the volume cannot be attached
    -h                  This help menu
    -v                  Turn on trace/debug mode
